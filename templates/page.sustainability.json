So, we spent nearly two years in quality-testing trials and seeking approval from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.<\/p><p>The wait was more than worth it. In 2022, we’re excited to start the transition to Grounded Packaging, and are proud to be one of the first companies to debut this home compostable vacuum-sealed bags to North America.<\/p><p>We use materials that are easiest on our oceans, and keep researching as new technology comes out. Beyond making our own offerings the best they can be, we want our peers to see what’s possible. If everyone else follows suit, we’d hope to reduce—and eventually eliminate—single-use items from the fishing industry.<\/p>",
